Single Player Pong for Arduino with 8x8 LED Matrix Display

The Arduino UNO sketch is a single player pong game. It uses a potentiometer to position a paddle at the bottom of the display and bounces a ball around the screen. The display is an 8x8 LED matrix driven by a pair of latching serial-to-parallel converters based on this [Sunfounder circuit](http://www.sunfounder.com/index.php?c=case_incs&a=detail_&id=100&name=super%20kit).
